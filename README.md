# Backend Challenges boilerplate - package.json
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-npm)](https://repl.it/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-npm)


# The learning moments: 

* Package.json stores information about your project, similar to how the <head> section of an HTML document describes the content of a webpage.

* The keywords field is where you can describe your project using related keywords.

* The license field is where you inform users of what they are allowed to do with your project. Some common licenses for open source projects include MIT and BSD.

* Semantic Versioning (SemVer), an industry standard for software versioning aiming to make it easier to manage dependencies.

* "package": "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"

* The MAJOR version should increment when you make incompatible API changes. The MINOR version should increment when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner. The PATCH version should increment when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

* To allow an npm dependency to update to the latest PATCH version, you can prefix the dependencyâ€™s version with the tilde (~) character.

*  ^caret will allow both MINOR updates and PATCHes.
